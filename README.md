# Stopwatch
A simple web app which runs timers or stopwatches.

## Why I created it?
This page is the result of my frustration with timer apps available desktop stopwatch apps. Even though there are other pages with similar capabilities, I decided to create my own and adjust it to my needs.

# What's the tech?
- HTML: this is a simple page, though I tried to follow semantic rules as much as possible.
- CSS: initial resetting is followed by BEM structure for the displayed components.
- JS: a single script holds DOM references and several functions are used for clock manipulation by subscription to click event of the buttons.

# Anything to add?
Sure. For now I plan the following extensions:
- add laps to the stopwatch, so a short history can be collected;
- add another view with timer functionality that a user can switch to;
- add a way to control precision;
- add graphics for old-school analog timer.
